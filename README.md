# library
This is the 1st project of the course JavaScript from the curriculum <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.

This project requires me to use the knowledge of Objects and Prototypes learned in the previous lessons, and apply them here to make a simple Library class.
